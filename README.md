# MEAN Stack Sample Application

This is a simple CRUD application built using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack.

## How To Run

Set your [Atlas URI connection string](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) as a parameter in `server/.env`. Make sure you replace the username and password placeholders with your own credentials.

```
ATLAS_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@sandbox.jadwj.mongodb.net/meanStackExample?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

Start the server and client applications:
```
npm start
```

When both applications are built and running, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/.
